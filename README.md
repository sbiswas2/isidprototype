# ISID Prototype
The International Society for Infectious Diseases partnered with a group of interns at IBM in the summer of 2018 with the goal to digitalize their Guide for Infectious Diseases and build a usable prototype.  This website just hosts the prototype so that users can interact with the mobile application to see how it could possibly be used by doctors, physicians, and infectious disease specialists around the world.  The mobile app was built using React Native, and uses Appetize.io technology to host the app so that we can embed an iframe into a simple website.  This website will be used for demonstration purposes only, not for commercial use.  All rights to the intellectual property that was created from the intern group are reserved and belongs to IBM.
